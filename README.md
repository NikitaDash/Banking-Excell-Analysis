# Banking-Excell-Analysis

## Overview
The consumer lending landscape has undergone significant transformation in recent years, driven by evolving economic conditions, technological advancements, and changing consumer behaviors. In this dynamic environment, lenders face the challenge of managing a diverse loan portfolio while balancing profitability with risk. The ability to effectively analyze and interpret loan data is crucial for making informed decisions and maintaining a competitive edge.

This project focuses on developing an advanced data analysis dashboard using Excel to provide comprehensive insights into loan portfolio management. By leveraging various data analysis techniques, the dashboard aims to assess loan risk profiles, evaluate financial performance metrics, understand borrower behaviors, and ultimately support strategic decision-making for financial institutions and stakeholders in the consumer lending sector.
